# RealEstateApp
Tillo - The Ultimate Real Estate App!


#Purpose
Purpose - This was an app that I had created during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program. The purpose of the project was to go beyond what we learned using routes, MongoDB and CRUD functionality to create a fully functional app. For me, I wanted to build a real estate app that allows users to track the properties that they are interested in as well as having the freedom to edit information, and delete houses that they are no longer interested in. 

#How it Works
How it works- The game that I created was inspired by battleship. Essentially within the grid Lego Minifigures or characters are scattered randomly. Each player takes their turn trying to strike grid boxes that they believe will have their opponent's minifigure. If itâ€™s a hit, then the minifigure location will be revealed and they are removed from the player's grid so that both players know which characters are still left on the battlefield. However, the player needs to be careful of hitting their own characters because that would mean points for the other team. Regular soldiers are only worth one points but special characters like Yoda and General Grievous are worth 5 points. The first player to reach the maximum of 18 points will win the game!

#Inspiration 
Inspiration - When I was a freshman in college, I learned about real estate rental properties investing from a millionaire entrepeneur and I was very obsesed with using real estate as a vehicle to make passive income. Now I have the chance to build an app that is not just for the class but is also for my and other people own use so that they too can track rental properties to invest in or look for their new home or place to rent.

#Why is this Important
Why is this important - This project can be of great use for anyone because everyone is looking for a place to rent/buy or they are looking for a place to invest in. Sometimes making a decision to buy/rent a place can be really hard as there can be many options out there and there can be many factors to keep track of like the number of rooms, the price, the amenities, whether the house is near a grocery store. In other words there's just so many things to keep track of for such a big decision to be made. But this app makes that process easier. [In addition as a part of the strach goals ...]
