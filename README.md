# Link to the Application on Heroku
Pending - Coming Soon!

# Purpose
I created the Tillow App during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program. The purpose of the project was to go beyond what we learned using MongoDB Atlas and  CRUD functionality to create a fully functioning full stack application deployed on Heroku. In addition, we were encouraged to use features that we had not learned in class just yet such as using the Multer package and adding and map API. For me, I wanted to build a real estate app that allows users to track the properties that they are interested in as well as having the freedom to edit information, and delete houses that they are no longer interested in. 

# How it Works
Tillow! Is a real estate app where users can add, edit and view houses that they are interested. Users can add new houses or modify existing houses with information such as adding an image (which is made functional by the Multer Package) and available amenities that come with the house. One cool feature is that users can actually view the house on the show page where they not only can see the information but they can also view the house on a map which is made functional by OpenLayers API.

# Inspiration 
When I was a freshman in college, I learned about real estate rental properties investing from an entrepreneur where I became very obsessed with using real estate as a vehicle to make passive income. Now I have the chance to build an app that is not just for the class but is also for my and other people own use so that they too can track rental properties to invest in or look for their new home or place to rent.

# Why is this Important
This project can be of great use for anyone because everyone is looking for a place to rent/buy or they are looking for a place to invest in. Sometimes making a decision to buy/rent a place can be really hard as there can be many options out there and there can be many factors to keep track of like the number of rooms, the price, the amenities, whether the house is near a grocery store. In other words there's just so many things to keep track of for such a big decision to be made. But this app makes that process easier.

# User Stories
As a home buyer, I want to be able to create a new house to track on the app, so that I can keep track of the houses I am interested 
As a home buyer, I want to be able to delete houses that I am no longer interested, to narrow down my final buying options. 
As a home buyer, I want to be able to add information to the house created such as price, address and amenities, so that I can compare the houses I am interested in. 
As a home buyer, I want to be able to edit information in case houses that I am interested in, change over time. 




# How I would Improve this Project
1) I could not get the checkboxes to render in the edit page when a user submitted a new change to the house, so that is something I would like to go back to and fix. For now I just removed that feature from the edit page in order to make MVP by the project deadline
2) I like the OpenLayers Map API feature a lot, but in my code I want to improve this feature by being able to show an exact marker of the location of the house. 
3) I want to add in the show page a status that tells you whether or not you are ready to make a down payment on that specific house based on how much money that you have saved up.
4)Originally I attempted to add user authentication so that users needed to sign in and are able to access their own houses. However when I attempted to do this, I it was not separating the user's houses from other accounts. Again, due to the tight project deadline I decided to remove this feature for now and make it a strech goal.
